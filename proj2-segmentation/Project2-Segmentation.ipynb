    "### What to Submit\n",
    "Submit this iPython Notebook--containing all your code for the programming exercises below--on [learning suite](https://learningsuite.byu.edu/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Your notebook file should produce the relevant plots and also provide a short write-up with answers to the questions below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please also fill in here the time that each part took you:\n",
    "* 1. Setting up PyMaxFlow: <span style=\"color:red;\">FILL IN TIME</span>\n",
    "* 2. Getting your first successful segmentation: <span style=\"color:red;\">FILL IN TIME</span>\n",
    "* 3. Adjusting parameters (e.g. $\\lambda$, $\\sigma$) and so forth, to get good results: <span style=\"color:red;\">FILL IN TIME</span>\n",
    "* 4. Completing the write-up: <span style=\"color:red;\">FILL IN TIME</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there are two folders within the project.  We have provided some images for you to use in testing your implementation, in the `provided images` folder along with their ground-truth segmentations to compare your results to.  Along with these, we want you to provide 2-4 additional images that you select on which you show your results.  <i>Please use the `provided_images` in that path and place any others in the `user_data` folder, and load all of the images (or user input point location files) via the approapriate relative path.  We will drop your notebook file and your `user_data` folder into our folder (which will have the `provided_images` already) and then run your notebook.</i>\n",

    "## Preparation:\n",
    "So that you can focus on the elements of the cost function ( the link weights), you may use a existing implementation of the actual min-cut algorithm itself.  You set up the graph, but it will take care of finding the minimum cut.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment we will be using a python library called PyMaxFlow.  This library is a python wrapper around the original C++ implementation of the min-cut code from [Vladimir Kolmogorov](http://pub.ist.ac.at/%7Evnk/software.html) (who has co-authored several papers on this subject).    \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: For windows users, you will need the Visual C++ compiler in order for PyMaxFlow to work.  If you already have Visual Studio, this shouldn't be a problem but if you just want the compiler without Visual Studio, you can download [Build Tools For Visual Studio 2017](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2017). Once you have access to the Visual C++ compiler look at the next paragraph for PyMaxFlow installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "PyMaxFlow requires Cython, which should come standard in your anaconda environment but the command to install that will also be included.  To install PyMaxFlow enter the following commands replacing \"YourEnvironmentName\" with the name of your anaconda environment.\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "conda activate YourEnvironemntName\n",
    "conda install cython\n",
    "pip install pymaxflow\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "Once PyMaxFlow is installed, to understand how to use the library, there is a great [tutorial page](http://pmneila.github.io/PyMaxflow/tutorial.html) that shows how to get started with some simple examples.  Do the \"first example\" and perhaps the \"binary image restoration\" as well."

    "## Graph Cut:\n",
    "Your code should read in an image and a set of seed pixels and use graph-cut segmentation to segment the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to calculate the costs for the t-links (region terms) and the n-links (boundary terms). See the book, the notes/slides, or published papers in this area for ideas of how to define these.  Remember that the t-link weights to a particular terminal (foreground or background) should be large if that pixel looks a lot like the respective foreground/background seeds. The n-link weights should be large if the two neighboring pixels are similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is [the original paper on graph-cut segmentation](http://www.csd.uwo.ca/~yuri/Papers/iccv01.pdf), which might help with some ideas, but you should look at the literature to see what other costs functions / link weights others have used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the graph is built, use the min-cut algorithm to partition the graph into nodes connected to the foreground node or to the background node, then use these as the resulting labels for the segmentation. Display this result graphically in some fashion overlaid on the input image.  It is best to start with simple images whose foreground and background colors are pretty different and for ones where the edges are pretty clear.  Graph-cut segmentation struggles sometimes with long, thin structures, so you should avoid these types of images early on.\n",
